Voyager Python Extractors
=========================

Python files in this directory that are properly named and will be picked up
by the VoyagerWorkerPy and used as extractors.

Extractor must follow this naming convention: *Extractor.py, and the name of the
file (everything before the .py) must also be the name of a class inside
the file. See the Md5Extractor.py as an example.

All files named with _ prefix are internal modules required for performing the extraction.
