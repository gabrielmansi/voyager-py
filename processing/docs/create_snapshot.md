#Create Snapshot

Creates an index snapshot of the items within the cart.

###Usage Tips
  - To index the entire index, clear the cart contents, delete all filters and queries add the entire index items to the cart.
  - To create a snapshot of a subset of items such as a specific location, you must use the Filters to filter content and those items to the cart for processing.
  - Text queries are supported. You can type in what you are looking for and add those items to the cart for processing.
  - Spatial queries are currently not supported. 
  - The path to Voyager's data folder must be specified.
  - The name of the snapshot will be prefixed with the current date and located in the backup folder with Voyager's data folder.
