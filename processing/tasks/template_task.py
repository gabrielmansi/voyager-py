The request is a dictionary loaded from a .json file and contains the parameter information necessary
to perform the operation. The info folder contains json files that define the parameters of the task.
Refer to the pretend_task.info.json file for list of parameter types. Create a new json file that
contains the name of the task with the suffix, .info.json (e.g. clip_data.info.json). The task_utils module
contains utility functions and additional functions that can be used by multiple tasks should be added there.
The status module can be use to add status to your task."""
